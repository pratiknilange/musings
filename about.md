# About
\
Hey, I am Pratik. I am an engineer and a self-taught graphic designer living in Bangalore. I pay my bills working as a software developer at TCS BaNCS. I [read books](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/120733875-pratik-nilange?shelf=read), draw doodles, write nonsense, and cycle very little. I also occasionally take pictures on my iPhone and post them on [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/186635911@N03/) (why not [Instagram](https://instagram.com/pratiknilange), you ask? Well, I’m not a fan of their compression algorithm). This blog is a collection of my tl;dr thoughts on all unimportant things I come across (kindly ignore my crap grammar. If you are a member of the grammar police service, you can publicly humiliate me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nilnge). Or, you can be a good person and sponsor me a Grammarly Premium subscription). I love watching movies and Gordon Ramsay’s [Kitchen Nightmares](https://www.youtube.com/c/kitchennightmares). I congratulate people on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/nilange) and remember birthdays on [Facebook](https://facebook.com/pratnil). Unsolicited advice is welcome via [email](mailto:pratik@nilange.com) or [messenger pigeon](https://www.wikihow.com/Train-a-Homing-Pigeon). If you want to send something secret, here’s my [public PGP key](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x1427739c6aeb0f9719bebecacfbeff48d4ea330b).
